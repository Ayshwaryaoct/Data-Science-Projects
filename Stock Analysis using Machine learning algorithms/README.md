SECTOR ANALYSIS & PREDICTION OF STOCK TRENDS
PROJECT PROPOSAL


April 5, 2018
Overview
Project Background and Description

The fundamental aim of this project is to comprehensively investigate the most influential macro, micro and fundamental factors of stock movements in different sectors-Finance, Information Technology, Pharmaceuticals and Energy. This Project includes 12 companies, 3 under each sector. The daily stock prices, micro , macro variables are extracted from February 1998 to January 2018. The project will compare and analyse the performance of various statistical models in predicting the stock trend as positive, negative or neutral.
Team members: Ayshwarya, Geethanjali, Sai Ishwarya, Tina.



Data Sources
Dataset is built by extracting values using Selenium , as web crawler. Variables are downloaded from Ycharts and Yahoo finance.  Data ranges from Feb , 1998 and Feb , 2018.
 Three companies are chosen from each sector and data is collected using Selenium. Micro-economic and Macro-economic variables like PE Ratio , Book Value , CPI (Inflation rate)  are extracted and separate data sets are maintained for each sector.
