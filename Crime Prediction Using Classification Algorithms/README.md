Crime-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning-Classification Models :-

Develop predictive models for crime, to help the police departments around the country to use machine learning to better focus their resources on locations where crimes are more likely to be committed. Python 3.6 is used with Scikit-learn 0.19.1. Code developed using Jupyter notebook. Data for per-capita crime rates around the country is taken. Task is to build models to predict the crime rate based on demographic and economic information about the particular locality. The data is given in the files “communities-crime-clean.csv” and “communities-crime-full.csv”; a description of the data and data fields is given in “communities-crime.names”. The “full” dataset includes data fields with missing values (indicated by “?”), while in the “clean” set these fields have been removed. <br/>
